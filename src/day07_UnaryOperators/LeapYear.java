     create a class called LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given is Leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false
        Ex:
                year = 2020
            output:
                2020 is leap year: true
                year = 2021
            output:
                2021 is leap year: false

                2020 % 4  < 1
        Hint: if the number of year can be evenly divisible by 4, it's known as leap year
